# save-date-calender
The purpose of this calender is to showcase Jquery and how it interacts with a page to allow someone to create memos throughout a workday and save them, with each hour being co9lor coded based on being either the past, present, or future hour. Anything put inside the memos will be saved and appear on the page once it is refreshed.
